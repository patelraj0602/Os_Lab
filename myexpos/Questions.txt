1. Can I delete any .xsm file which I loaded in OS bootstrap code(block 0 and 1).
Sol: You cannot delete anything instead you can overwrite it. Every time you load anything to OS bootstrap(block 0,1) it actually overwrites the content already present.
Also the content of the OS bootstrap area(block 0,1) does not changes when I use fdisk(format the disk).

2. How do I use an assembler to debug my .xsm code before loading it into OS bootstrap area.
Sol: They haven't provided assembler.

3. How to implement loops in XSM architecture.
Sol: Same as we did in CO but for jmp we need to give an actual memory address.

4. Is it possible to add comments, newline, spaces in an xsm file.
Sol: No it is not possible

5. Is it possible to write an application program using spl programming language.
Sol: ????

6. How to use run command of xfs-interface?
Sol: ????

7. How come we can use labels in privileged mode but not in unpriviledged mode??
